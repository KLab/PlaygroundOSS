============================== File System =================================

The platform provides a set of APIs to handle files in the target OS file system.

IReadStream defines an Interface for Read Stream classes.
It provides methods for file decryption.
Read data can either be u8, u16, u32, float or blocks.
	
Group A
	IReadStream*	openReadStream(...);

Group B
	ITmpFile*		openTmpFile(...);
	void			removeTmpFile(...);

Group C
	void*			ifopen	(...)
	void			ifclose	(...)
	int				ifseek	(...)
	u32				ifread	(...)
	u32				ifwrite	(...)
	int				ifflush	(...)
	long int		iftell	(...)
	bool			icreateEmptyFile(...)

	
The file path has always the following format coming from the game engine :
	
	file://external/fileName
	file://install/fileName
	asset://fileName
	
By using a notation like that we can extend later to other system like "socket://"

file://install/ is the root of the data for the application, where the package
has been downloaded and installed, considered as a READ ONLY area inside the file system.
(or ROM if you prefer)

file://external/ is the base of the area where data can be freely modified and updated
independently from the application package files.

When using the "asset://folder/file.ext" addressing, 
we check first if "file://external/folder/file.ext" does exist.
-> If so we return the stream object accessing the file.
-> If not, we then check "file://internal/folder/file.ext"

So, the implementation checks FIRST in the updatable storage for a given file,
and if not found, try to find it inside the application package.

Such mechanism allows to update, load new modules without worrying about the change
of path inside the game content.

Because path format, default root and file permission may be different betweens OSes,
the path search and conversion from abstract "game path" to physical path is done
inside the porting layer of each platform.
	
Each platform porting layer is in charge of converting logical paths into physical paths 
for each specific platform.
It provides instance of the IReadStream.

There are not much file writing activity, except for the downloading itself.
(Information that are written over and over are saved on server side or client side DB).

So the engine relies mainly on openReadStream(...) to access files.

The group B APIs : openTmpFile / removeTmpFile APIs are only used in
	CKLBAsyncFileCopy
	CKLBUpdate
	
The group C APIs : it has been added later when encryption was added to the engine later on.
This addition just exists for the purpose of supporting encryption inside SQLite, and 
all these APIs are called from CKLBDatabase.cpp

Now, there is also a IWriteStream interface that is used only for debugger protocol, but
is not an essential part of the engine.
(See source/Core/DebugTracker.cpp)

- IWriteStream
	IWriteStream defines an Interface for Write Stream classes.
	Written data can either be u8, u16, u32, float or blocks.

We have also included here the files about socket stream because they inherit from IReadStream / IWriteStream.
But also those are not used anymore inside the engine.
