======================== Rendering  =============================

The rendering is actually composed of two modules.
- The OpenGLES wrapper. (OGLWrapper)                            (A)
- The rendering system of the engine itself using OGLWrapper.   (B)

There is also something related to rendering, but 

A/ The OpenGLES wrapper
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The goal is to avoid having the engine or upper layer to
be dependant on a specific rendering APIs.
Moreover, by wrapping OpenGL concept with C++ objects,
it makes life cycle management and setup much more convenient.

It is a self-contained system and have no dependancy except OpenGL/OpenGLES
It also has some features to make life easier concerning texture management
(double buffering, handling atlas and UV coordinates).

B/ The rendering system.

It is a list in order of rendering commands, executed each frame.

B.1 - The rendering system is working as the following :

	1  - Parse a list of render commands.
	2A - If the render command has a triangle to draw, takes the XY, UV, color information
	  and tries to group them (batch) by rendering state to minimize the number of draw calls to GPU.
	2B - If the render command changes the gpu state or applies specific GPU command, it executes them.

	The XY and color are recomputed by the scene graph when necessary (= when changes occur)
	before the rendering system is executed.

	First, the rendering system is simply a singleton of the CKLBRenderingManager class
	which owns datas to perform rendering on :
	- Link list of all the render command objects.
	- Index Buffer, Vertex Buffer for batching.
		- List of indexes for triangle soup.
		- List of XY, UV, color buffers for vertices.


B.2 - Default matrix, default OpenGLES setup

	* We perform 2D rendering and control the rendering order of the polygons, moreover
	for all polygons being transparent there is no need for using a Z Buffer (except a few specific cases
	where clipping per pixel is needed). By doing so, we optimize the memory bandwidth necessary to perform rendering.

	* Because all the vertices have colors attribute and we prefer to do batches, all the rendering
	are done using this render state :
		Pixel = Texture * Interpolated Vertex Color (modulate)
		including alpha blending.
		
	* Transformation matrix is done in a way that all our coordinates for objects
	are TOP-LEFT in pixel coordinate.

- Coordinates system : Logical Screen Size, Physical Screen Size.

	Because devices have different screen size, it is important to design the application with only one
	screen size.
	There are scripting APIs to allow to setup a "logical screen size" (the screen size used when creating UI)
	and then the "physical screen size" (the device).
	By being able to setup a logical screen size, it is possible to use/reuse parts created for another resolution.
	The OpenGL matrix is updated accordinly to match the physical screen size when using logical screen size data.

- Render Commands classes inheritance.

* CKLBRenderCommand				: Abstract render command, does nothing.
	* CKLBRenderState			: Executes a render state change
		Clears, Actives, Desactivates Z Buffer
		Z Buffer Range
		Stencil Buffer Management (Never used)
		Changes of shaders (when shader compatible GPU)
	* CKLBSprite				: Basic class for drawable polygon.
		Supports a fixed amount of vertex (XY,UV,Color), indexes.
		Uses image asset as source.
		
		* CKLBSprite4_6			: Optimized version of CKLBSprite
			The role of this class is to have a member array with
			6 indexes and 4 vertices.
			Thus, there is no need to allocate buffers for XY and UV coordinates.
			Neither allocation for colors.
			Instead the class is limited to the use of "rectangular" images.
			
		* CKLBDynSprite			: More generic sprite where it is possible to
			setup the number of vertices, the indexes, setup XY, UV and colors freely.
			Usefull for doing tricks with UV, showing part of images, etc...
			
			* CKLBSpriteScale9	: It is a special image composed with 9 rectangles,
			the corners are of fixed size, 
			the bottom and up edges are stretched horizontally,
			left and right edges are stretched vertically.
			
			ie : ABC          ABBBBBC
			     DEF     ---> DEEEEEF
			     GHI          GHHHHHI
				 
			ie : ABC          ABBBBBC
			     DEF          DEEEEEF
			     GHI          DEEEEEF
			     	          DEEEEEF
			                  GHHHHHI
							  
			A,C,G,I corners are of fixed size.
			B and H are stretched horizontally.
			D and F are stretched vertically.
			E is stretched against both axis.
			
			This component is usefull to draw many different variation of the same image
			without sacrifying memory.
			
			* CKLBPolyline		:
			Render command that take like and convert them into rectangle with thickness,
			allowing to draw lines.
			This primitive was created only to perform some debug information and was
			never used into production. The quality of the lines connection is inexistant.
			
		* CKLBCanvasSprite
		
			It is like a dynamic sprite with a maximum amount of vertices and indexes.
			It allowed to perform "local" rendering of images into one sprite that act like
			a batch.
			
			Simple use case :
			There is a fixed background composed of multiple tiled images, like a maze.
			
			It is of course possible to create multiple images instance, setup each coordinate.
			But if you are concerned with performance and ressource usage, it would be better
			to batch all those vertices and indexes into ONE batch of polygons.
			
			Basically the canvas sprite allows the programmer to create a batch of images drawn as a single static
			sprite.
			
		* CKLBSprite3D
			It is code that have never been in production but only made as a prototype to use 3D objects
			inside the game engine.

- Text Rendering

	At first we had text rendering done by each platform. But the slight differences between platforms were
	too much different in some cases. We ended up having our own font rendering system.
	Of course, complex language are not handled correctly as we are doing a basic usage of freeType for our renderer.
	
	The system is the following :
	FontObject class :	Owns the list of FontObject and handles life-cycle of font using reference counter.
						Perform the rendering of strings of characters.
						Mapping between a logical font name and physical font file.
						Owns root of the font dictionnary mapping unicode id and cached character.
	
	CharCache class :	Array of CharCache represent a pool of free and used cached character.
						Has information about font object, cached glyph bitmap, rendering offsets.
						
						When a cache entry is used or created, it is always put at the top of the list.
						When there are no cache entry available for a new uncached character,
						the most bottom item is reused as new one and old character information are deleted.
						
						Basically act as a big MRU of the size of the cache table.
						
	
	CharDictionnary class :
						Allows to create a tree to map unicode id (32 bits) <-> CharCache entry.
						- Node of CharDictionnary tree.
						- Use a radix based child table (4 bits -> 16 children).
						- The last item uses its child index to store an index to CharCache instead of CharDictionnary.
						
						As a unicode is 32 bits, cut in 4 bits slices, the depth for any complete entry is 8 in depth.
	
	Rendering is optimized using a tricky format :
	- The bitmap cache for a glyp is using a "mask table".
	  We are cutting the glyph into vertical bands of 32 bits.
	  And then rely on the mask to perform the rendering : 
	  - No need to test for valid/invalid pixels.
	  - Early termination test is for free.
	  
	- The value for each pixel in the cache is an unsigned 8 bits value.
	  We convert them into RGB values when performing the rendering to the target surface.
