============================== Scene graph ==================================

The Scene Graph is used to represent a hierarchy of 2D transformation and color transformation.
The base class which is a node of the tree is CKLBNode.

Each node owns a list of render objects to apply the transformations to.
The rendering order is not linked to the geometry order, basically the hierarchy DOES NOT
define the order of rendering. Each render object has its own order.

So, it is important to understand that scene graph and rendering are dependant in order :
|<---   Scene graph domain                --->|<--- Rendering Domain                      --->|
 [Tree is modified] -> [Tree is recomputed]  ---> [Render is recomputed] -> [Render performed]

1 - Modification of the tree
	Each tasks creating node will modify the properties like scaling, color, etc...
	Because multiple properties could be changed by many tasks within the same frame we
	avoid recomputing/updating the tree in place (= each time a modification is made)
	
	Instead we store information inside the tree to tell the recomputation process later on
	that specific changes have occured.
	
	- Mark the node that was change, specific bit exist of each type of change.
	- Mark the uppers node until the root to signal that children has been changed.
	
2 - Recomputation of the tree
	The recomputation will parse the tree once per frame and recompute the tree information,
	perform tree transformation on the render object for the rendering phase.
	
	Basically the following computation occurs :
	- Node compute its "composed" matrix with its parent matrix and local Matrix :
		Composed          = Parent          * Own Matrix
	- Same for colors
		Composed Color    = Parent Color    * Own Color
	- Apply the transformation to the rendering object
		For each vertices :
		-------------------
		Screen Coordinate = Composed Matrix * Own Coordinate
		Screen Color      = Composed Color  * Own Color
	
	Note : Optimization of the tree
	-------------------------------------
	Because of the marking we have made when modifying the tree, we can understand if a sub tree
	has changed or not, thus we can skip some part of the recomputation, avoid recomputing
	some part of the rendering object too.
	
3 - Root node is owned by CKLBDrawResource singleton, 
	accessible using CKLBDrawResource::getInstance().getRoot()

Technical Limitations 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some nodes are linked to system object or feature that can NOT perform any rotation or scaling when displayed.
So, you must know when to use rotation or scaling.

- Clipping (uses OpenGLES glScissor)
- Text input box for the OS (depends on each OS implementation)
- Web Browser
- Movie (OS will provide the player and display/overlay)


Technical Note:
A CKLBNode can be linked with a UITask.
In that case, the UITask and the CKLBNode will point each other.
Moreover, the CKLBNode will be protected from destruction untill the UITask is destroyed.

### Sub Classes

- CKLBSystem
	CKLBSystem provides static methods to manage the Animation Node List.
	It allows to separate the Node System from the rest of the Game Engine.
	
	Sources : 	source/SceneGraph/CKLBNode.h
				source/Animation/CKLBSystem.cpp

- CKLBNode
	CKLBNode is the root class for the Scene Graph.
	Every Element of the Scene Graph is a CKLBNode or a derivated class.
	Each CKLBNode owns a list of render objects to apply the transformations to.
	The transformations are defined by matrices also owned by the CKLBNode.
	
	A CKLBNode can be linked with a CKLBUITask and in that case, they will point
	each other. Moreover, the CKLBNode will be protected from destruction untill 
	the CKLBUITask is destroyed.
	
	Important points about the Scene Graph System :
	- add/remove do also add/remove to the animation and rendering if associated 
		bit or object are set.
	- add takes in account the fact that upper node of new_ node is visible to perform 
		the modification in animation and rendering.
	- node destruction also destroy all the sub system and includes render object associated.

- CKLBUITask
	Adds an integrated node to the task, the task owns a node connected to the scene graph.
	The node also has a pointer to the task.
	Refer to the CKLBUITask for more details (Docs/Modules/Tasks.txt and Docs/Documentation_Tasks.txt).
