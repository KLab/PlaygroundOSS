============================== Task System ==================================

The only thing executed each frame by the engine is the task manager.
Anything that must be executed by the CPU each frame must register a task to the task manager.

The task manager works the following way :
- There are what is called PHASES. It defines the order of execution.
	(See TASK_PHASE inside CKLBTask.h)
	
- There are tasks that are registered to a given phase.
	Note that a task instance can only be registered to one and only one phase at a given time.
	
- Order of execution INSIDE a phase are not guaranteed.
	-> We guarantee that a phase is executed before another, but not the task order within a phase.
	
- Tasks can have parent/child relationship.
	When a task is destroyed, all the subtree is destroyed at the same time.

- When killing a task, the task is NOT destroyed immediatly but at the end of the current frame execution ;
	that means after all the phases have been executed for this frame.
	It helps to guarantee that pointers are not becoming unavailable if tasks have pointers on other tasks and
	guarantee the integrity of all tasks for a given frame.
	

Class Groups:

Event if all Tasks inherits the root class CKLBTask (see "Classes" in this document for more details),
there are splitted in 2 groups : System Tasks and User Tasks.
- System Tasks are tasks created when launching the game and not controlled by the programmer.
- User Tasks are tasks the programmer can instanciate through LUA (or another scripting language).
	They all inherits from CKLBLuaTask previously described.
	User Tasks can also be splitted in 2 groups : 
		- User UI Tasks (all UI related tasks).
		- User Other Tasks (download, unzip, network, etc).
	
	For more details about specific Tasks of any group refer to Docs/Documentation_Tasks.md


Tasks may not need to be executed every single frame, for instance if a progress bar had not moved from the previous frame,
recompute it and redraw it would be a loss of cpu usage.
That is why, in an optimization purpose, tasks can enter a Sleep state by themselves (meaning not like a Pause from the script).

A flag system has been deployed, using a 1 byte member and macros.
By default, a task is ALWAYS_ACTIVE. (0x80)
If you want a sub task to be not always active, you have to call setNotAlwaysActive() in the subclass constructor,
this will desactivate the flag at 0x80. We strongly suggest to use this only in the constructor to differenciate
tasks who can sleep and those which ALWAYS need to execute at each frame.

Then, for tasks which can sleep, we have different flags.
Those flag are generic in the way that the programmer can decide to use them for any purpose.

5 flags macros are available for a Task activity (from A to E). If one of them is Up, the task is considered as active and
execute function will be called as long as the flag is not reset.

- Flag A (0x01)	: REFRESH_A, CHANGE_A, RESET_A macros
- Flab B (0x02)	: REFRESH_B, CHANGE_B, RESET_B macros
- Flag C (0x04)	: REFRESH_C, CHANGE_C, RESET_C macros
- Flag D (0x08)	: REFRESH_D, CHANGE_D, RESET_D macros
- Flag E (0x10)	: REFRESH_E, CHANGE_E, RESET_E macros

REFRESH_x will SET the flag to 1.
CHANGE_x will return if the flag is set or not. So programmer can do something like : if (CHANGE_x) { ... }
RESET_x will RESET the flag to 0.

Most of the common case is to set a flag when a property is changed, and then perform the real update only once
per frame. To different what kind of update has been made to the object, the programmer can use freely those flags.

When the TaskManager process the Tasks List and execute every one of them, it first tests if the task is indeed 
active or not. If not, the call to the execute method is not done.
A task is active either if it is "Alaways Active" or if one of the 5 flags is up.


IMPORTANT: === Only needed if modifying the library instead of using the main project ===
If you want to add/remove task from the library project (inside Win32 project), 
it is important to modify EngineStdReference.cpp
The reason for this file to exist is that when compiling all the tasks inside a library, each
task creates a singleton template factory. But because nobody is referencing directly the singleton
outside of the library, thus the linker does not incluse the singleton and the factory is not available at runtime.
(Worked without this system when the project was inside a single project)

So you need to modify EngineStdReference.h with :
- #include your header 
- go inside the EngineTaskReference() function and then add/remove the call to the task.

Note about destruction of task owning nodes (UITask) :

Task using node in the scene graph will need delete the node they created.
If the node is connected to the scene graph when the task dies, it is automatically destroyed due to connection
with the task "local root" node.

Now, if a node belonging to a task B is connected to a node from task A, when task A dies, the node belonging to task B is NOT destroyed.

Here is the schematic:
---------------------------------
Task A with Node A'
	Node A2'
		Task B with node B'
			Node B2'
	Node A3'
---------------------------------

Normally a tree should delete all the node by recursion on destruction,
but as the node belong to another task, we avoid the destruction of those sub node (B' and B2') when killing taks A.
Only node A',A2',A3' are going to be automatically deleted.

Because task B does NOT know that task A has been destroyed in the scene graph and we do not want task B to delete the
node B' and B2' a second time ! So when A dies, it has NO RIGHTS to destroy a node belonging to another task.

Just remember that Task parent (relation between task) and scene graph relation (task parent inside a form) are not related.
A given task B inside another task A inside the scene graph could have task B as child of task A in term of execution.

Classes:
	CKLBTaskMgr (Singleton)
		Performs the execution of each phase.
		Provides management for tasks.
		
	CKLBTask
		Basic task class, provides mecanisms for init/die/execute, phase ownership, name.
		Refer to Docs/Modules/Scripting.txt for more details about scripting tasks.
		
		CKLBLuaTask : 
		Adds feature to have command executable from LUA.
			
			CKLBLuaPropTask : 
			Adds properties accessible from LUA.
				
				CKLBUITask : 
				Adds an integrated node to the task, the task owns a node connected to the scene graph.
				The node also has a pointer to the task.

How To Add A New Task ?

If you want to add new tasks to the Game Engine, please follow these instructions.
We will consider that your new task is name MyNewTask.

- Make MyNewTask inherits CKLBTask or a subclass of CKLBTask.
- In include/BaseType.h add a new define :
	#define CLS_MYNEWTASK (XXX | CLS_KLBUSERTASK | ...)
	refer to the defines at the beginning of the file.
- Add CKLBTaskFactory<MyNewTask> as a friend class.
- In the cpp file, add 
	static CKLBTaskFactory<MyNewTask> factory("MyNewTask", CLS_MYNEWTASK);
- Add the following methods :
	- static MyNewTask* create(...) : tries to allocate the task and call init(...).
	- bool init(...) : ends with a call to CKLBTask::regist(parent, phase) to add this task 
		to a specific phase of the Game Engine.

- Override the following methods :
	- u32 getClassID()	: must return CLS_MYNEWTASK.
	- void execute(u32 deltaT) : contains the execution instructions.

- You may add setNotAlwaysActive() in the contructor for optimization purpose.
	Refer to Docs/Documentation_Tasks.md for more details about tasks execution.

For more details about LuaTask and derived classes implementation, refer to Docs/Modules/Scripting.txt
	
If it is a LuaPropTask
- In the constructor, add :
	m_newScriptModel = true;
- Add properties :
	- .h 	: 
		static	PROP_V2		ms_propItems[];
	- .cpp 	: 
		CKLBLuaPropTask::PROP_V2 MyNewTask::ms_propItems[] = {
			{	"prop1",	UINTEGER,	(setBoolT)&MyNewTask::setProp1,	(getBoolT)&MyNewTask::getOrder,	0 },
			{	"prop2",	R_STRING,	NULL,							(getBoolT)&MyNewTask::getAsset,	0 },
			...
		};
	
If it is a CKLBUITask

- .cpp
	Don't forget to add the CKLBUITask properties to your Task ones, with the macro UI_BASE_PROP.
	CKLBLuaPropTask::PROP_V2 MyNewTask::ms_propItems[] = {
			UI_BASE_PROP,
			{	"prop1",	UINTEGER,	(setBoolT)&MyNewTask::setProp1,	(getBoolT)&MyNewTask::getOrder,	0 },
			{	"prop2",	R_STRING,	NULL,							(getBoolT)&MyNewTask::getAsset,	0 },
			...
		};
		
	- Override the following methods 
		- initCore 	: initializes the members.
		- initUI	: initializes the script values.
	
	If you want to add commands accessible from the Script, override the commandUI method.

For more details, please refer to a simple task implementation such as source/UISystem/CKLBUISimpleItem.h
