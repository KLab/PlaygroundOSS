At first, the core system is CKLBHTTPInterface class.
Each instance of this class is an HTTP connection to the server.

Each time the connection starts, a thread executing the connection is started.

The HTTP and socket connection support is done using the LibCurl library.

There is a special trick about error handling:
Some server do suddenly cut the connection if there is zero byte of payload,
resulting in an error when actually everything went OK.
So we check the error code sent by the server into a temporary variable when
receiving the header from the server and then override the error code from curl
with our temporary variable if we have CURL error with a zero byte payload.

CKLBHTTPInterface has also various functions to :
- Save the HTTP stream to file system.
- Use POST or GET method.
- Know how much of the data has already been downloaded / download complete.

To avoid having HTTP connections created directly, the CKLBHTTPInterface class is
not directly accessible. (private constructor)

Instead, we use the NetworkManager singleton which controls each connection so
we know how many connection threads are currently active.

The ConnectionEntry class is an element of the link list for each active connection.

CKLBUpdate is a task that download a file and unzip it.
CKLBUpdateZip is task that perform only the zip when the file is already downloaded and saved.
(Those use the same code, just different start state in their internal state machine)

Add two functions to lua library to check if a lock exists and destroy the lock.

We are using a lock mechanism (creating a lock file) in case if the appli fails while downloading,
we know that something went wrong and can restart/complete the operation.

CKLBNetAPI is a task that perform network connection to a server.
It has the following possibilities :
	- Use Get or Post method
	- Cancel connection
	- Handle time out
	- Setup the headers for the connection
	
	Each instance of CKLBNetAPI task can only work with ONE connection at a time.
	So the user need to wait a callback that the download is complete, failed or has timed out. else it is also possible
	to cancel a connection.
	
	The system only receive result in Json format which is sent back to LUA.
	
	Here is the LUA command for the constructor :
	pNetTaskVariable = HTTP_API("myNetCallbackFunction")	-- Pass the callback function
	
	Here is the various LUA commands possible after construction :
	
	-- sysCommand(task, NETAPI_SEND, url, header, payload, timeout) : start a connection
	sysCommand(pNetTaskVariable, NETAPI_SEND, "http://someserverdomain.com/urlapi/", {a="Hello", b="World"}, "{\"payload\":true}", 30000)
	
	-- sysCommand(task, NETAPI_CANCEL) : cancel the connection if any
	sysCommand(pNetTaskVariable, NETAPI_CANCEL)
	
	-- sysCommand(task, NETAPI_BUSY) : return true if the connection is currently active, false if no connection
	isBusy = sysCommand(pNetTaskVariable, NETAPI_BUSY)
	
	Here is the callback function format :
	
	function myNetCallbackFunction(connectionID, message, status, bodyPayload)
		-- connectionID is always 0 for historical reason with our internal version of the network APIs.
		-- message has the following values :
		--   NETAPIMSG_CONNECTION_FAILED
		--   NETAPIMSG_SERVER_ERROR
		--   NETAPIMSG_SERVER_TIMEOUT
		--   NETAPIMSG_REQUEST_SUCCESS
		-- status is the server status code, but return -1 if connection could not happen
		-- bodyPayload is a json item tree
	end

There is a singleton just to store key chain related information for network implementation.

This is more a utility than networking feature, but it is used mainly in networking.
When receiving a JSon stream from a server response, the stream is parsed and converted into a tree
of CKLBJSonItem and then to an equivalent LUA object tree sent back to LUA.
It is used by mainly by CKLBNetAPI and derived work.

Considering billing/stores APIs, not sure if it can be considered as "networking" primitive, 
still they surely connect in the background and do a lot of work.
CKLBStoreService is responsible for the different interactions with the Application Store,
as getting the products list or buying items.
This task is platform independent as it uses IPlatformRequest to process its requests.
