============================== Audio ==================================

There are two ways to load audio data :
- One is to use LUA API directly and manage audio data with control APIs.
- One is to use audio resource link inside a form.
	(See Assets.txt for Audio)

Core Audio APIs are provided by the platform layer to be standardized
for all platforms.

These APIs are called from the following system in the game engine :
- Called from Audio Asset wrapper.
- Called by LUA binding APIs.
- SWF Player

Audio files support encryption same as any other resources.
(For more details about encryption support, see Encryption.txt)

Inside the tool when you compile for iPhone, the audio is MP3.
When compiling for Android, the audio output is OGG.

Because of licensing issue, it may be worth to pass everything to OGG
but in this case, you may loose the advantage of the performance gain but will have to pay
licenses using MP3 for games.
given by device maker optimization. (ie hardware codec, or very optimized software codec)
(http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/games.html)

Anyway, the OSS version of the engine is OGG for Android, MP3 for Win32 and iOS.

Each platform has a specific implementation depending on the underlying OS
APIs available, optimisation of resources, streaming, etc...
What is important to know is that we have a thread that control the volume
for each audio object currently playing.

Note : we also have a version for Win32 using OggVorbis instead of MP3 but is not
yet used in production.
