================================ Assets ====================================

The Asset Manager (CKLBAssetManager) is the class in charge of all assets life cycle
and of the assets loader plugins.

This class is a singleton and has a pool of assets.

A SAssetEntry is a basic structure :

struct SAssetEntry {
	CKLBAbstractAsset*	m_pAsset;
	bool				m_isFree;
	u16					m_prev;
	u16					m_next;
};

It uses an allocator with a list of used and free SAssetEntry.
Pool size is defined when the game engine starts. (See "Allocators.txt")

It can load a maximum of 65534 assets.

The Asset Manager is also able to register and unregister IKLBAssetPlugins. 
Using IKLBAssetPlugins allows the different assets to be loaded differently depending on 
the type of asset that have to be loaded.

CKLBAbstractAsset is the root class for all assets definition.
Each abstract asset has a name (for debug purpose), an ID (runtime decided),
and the methods incrementRefCount() and decrementRefCount() which can be used 
to lock an instance of this asset. If the reference counter falls to 0, 
it is automatically removed from the CKLBAbstractAsset list of the Asset Manager.

It also defines the following virtual methods : onRegisterSubAsset() and onUnregisterSubAsset()
doing nothing by default. They can be overwritten in subclasses.

IKLBAssetPlugin defines an interface for the Asset plugins being defined in the Engine.
Among other methods, it defines a method loadAsset(u8* stream, u32 streamSize).

The manager allows to find an asset by an asset name :
Example "asset://myfolder/asset.ext"

The manager knows the logical name of each asset loaded and decided to load automatically the asset
if not already loaded. File system acts as database of assets.
There are cases where one asset file will actually own multiple assets, thus a need to have multiple path
pointing to the same asset.(.LNK file)

How To Add A New Asset Type ?

How to create new assets and use them :
- Create your own plugin derived from IKLBAssetPlugin.
- Create your own asset derived from CKLBAbstractAsset or CKLBAsset based on the type.
- Export a file format that has a header supporting the getChunkID() from the plugin OR use
  API calls with a specific plugin. 
  -> Loader will recognize your file by using a header if you have no plugin set during the function call.

=============================================================================

LINK file

When an asset embed multiple assets, as we have a unique file path to access each sub asset, it can create a problem.
=> We can create an asset file that will reroute to another asset that really owns all the data.

The file will own a LINK header instead of a normal plugin header, and have information to reroute to another file.

To make the understanding easier :
----------------------------------

For the sake of understanding all the asset are in the root folder.
A texture "A.texb" have 3 images "IMG1.imag", "IMG2.imag", "IMG3.imag".

Thus :
"asset://IMG1.imag"
"asset://IMG2.imag"
"asset://IMG3.imag" are the assets we want to access

"asset://A.texb" is the real file having the texture and all the IMG*.imag assets.

A file IMG1.imag does exist, but inside there is just a LINK header pointing to A.texb
Same for IMG2.imag and IMG3.imag

You can look at compiled image asset.

=============================================================================

About plugin direct call + Asset with/without using header.

When creating new tasks for your game, you can use as an example the following APIs.
See CKLBUtility::readAsset
See CKLBUtility::loadAsset

By passing a plugin, we can access a file which has no header and directly read the stream
as an asset stream.

If the plugin is not given, then a header IS necessary at the beginning of the file.

In some cases it is usefull : JSON file as an example have no header, and different
asset could use JSON as an exchange format.

=============================================================================
Note about audio assets :

	1/ Audio assets are "just" wrappers around objects given by the porting layer,
	and are actually used only by the form asset loader.
	2/ Audio assets used by LUA are directly using Audio Object from the porting layer,
	so technically they are NOT assets from the point of view of the engine.
	
	Considering that Audio Asset are not used globally, it defeat the whole point
	of wrapping and modularity of the design. A possible refactoring would be
	to remove completly Audio Asset and related code and directly use Audio object
	inside the engine.
	
	The only role here for Audio asset is to avoid loading the same audio object
	multiple times. By using the asset management system we get unique assets.

# Assets
- CKLBAbstractAsset
	Generic basic asset, owns the reference counting mecanism.
	
	Sources : 	source/Assets/CKLBAsset.h
				source/Assets/CKLBAssetManager.cpp
	
- CKLBAsset
	Asset that can create a part of the scene graph when instancing.
	
	Sources : 	source/Assets/CKLBAsset.h
	
- CKLBAudioAsset
	Wrapper for audio object given by porting layer, used only by 
	
	Sources :	source/Assets/AudioAsset.h
				source/Assets/AudioAsset.cpp
	
- CKLBTextureAsset
- CKLBImageAsset
	Texture asset is a texture that describes a 2D texture uploaded to the GPU.
	Inside a texture asset file, we also store a list of 2D models.
	A 2D model is a list vertices and related indexes for rendering triangles. 
	Basically, one model is an image asset.
	There are also various attributes that are stored within an image asset.
	
	Sources : 	source/Assets/CKLBAsset.h
				source/Assets/CKLBAssetManager.cpp

- CKLBSWFAsset
	This is an asset that stores exported Flash movies from our converter.
	It contains animation information, link to needed images or sound assets and movie structure.
	Various information about label, movie length is also stored.
	
	Sources :	source/Animation/CKLBSWFPlayer.h
				source/Animation/CKLBSWFPlayer.cpp

- CKLBCompositeAsset
	CKLBCompositeAsset is an asset defining a "Form". 
	A Form is basically a tree of visual tasks and components.
	It allows to create a scene formed with tasks and UI objects without having to 
	heavily rely on scripting. 
	Instead, a loader performs object creation and property setup.

				source/Assets/CompositeManagement.cpp
	
- CKLBCellAnimationAsset
- CKLBSplineAnimationAsset 
- CKLBNodeAnimationAsset
	Those assert virtually exist as implemented for some, but have never been used in production or completly.
	So for the time being we will not consider discussing those further.
	
	Note : could remove from the project.

Special note about asynchronous loading for textures :
	There is one special case where the asset is loaded by a seperated thread.
	In this case, the main engine thread MUST NOT execute any asset loading (= all tasks using ressources must NOT be created)

	The asset manager will perform the asset loading in another thread but transfer to OpenGL texture
	and texture creation will happen on the main thread.
