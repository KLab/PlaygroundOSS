============================== Allocators & Memory ==================================

1. Global Object & Array Allocation
First there are MACROS used for allocation/free.

KLBNEW(className)
KLBNEWA(type, count)
KLBDELETE(pointer)
KLBDELETEA(pointer)

Those macros are used only INSIDE the engine code, NOT inside the platform code.
When receiving a object that you must free yourself from the platform (ie like a string),
DO NOT USE those macros.

ie :
				|	Alloc Platform	| Alloc Engine
----------------------------------------------------
Free  Engine	|	NO MACRO		| Use Macro
Free  Platform	|	NO MACRO		| NEVER EXIST
----------------------------------------------------

Based on DEBUG_MEMORY flag, those macro behavior can change. (BaseType.h)

2. Pool.
There are a few places where pool allocator are used.

In source/core/ArrayAllocator.h, there is a template of a pool allocator.
The allocator work the following way :
- An array of struct is allocated.
- Each struct member with index in the array about the previous and next item.
- There are two link list in the allocator :
	- The list of free items.
	- The list of allocated items.

For now, indexes are limited to 16 bit, resulting in 65534 item available max.

The allocator is used in :
- The asset dictionnary node pool.
- The language dictionnary node pool.
- The 2D Texture packer nodes.
- The composite management loader ("form") CKLBInnerDef struct pool.
- The asset manager pool.(note : does NOT use the template but direct implementation of same mecanism)


3. Detailed Setup of memory amount for various pools and buffers when the engine start.
When the main class CKLBGameApplication start, each project implement a sub class and can override the setupAllocation(...) function.
(See CKLBGameApplication.h)

The following information can be setup :
- Default number of node for dictionnary (used for asset) : 15,000 by default.
- Asset Handler pool size.	: 10,000 by default.	x  8  byte each =  80 KB at start
- Number of asset slots.	:  1,000 by default.	x 12  byte each =  12 KB at start
- Template form node slots	: 10,000 by default.	x 240 byte each	= 2.4 MB at start
	Used by form loader for each "node"

Internal Stuff at startup are :
- CKLBTextTempBuffer is a singleton for a "temporary any use" buffer	= 32 KB at start
- TexturePacker with 2048x512 texture (SW buff + HW texture) in 4444 or 8888 depending on compile option = 4MB or 8MB at start.
- Each plugin instance and various singletons of each modules.
- Language database entry node = 72 KB at start.
- Rendering System consume per frame cache : 65000 vertex and 65000 indexes.
	128 KB for index
	1.2 MB for vertex
	per frame cached.
	
	In multithreaded rendering, we have 5 frames cached.
	
TexturePacker and Rendering system are the heavy weight in memory consumption at first,
those memory could be reduce by changing the limits (packer page size, maximum number of vertex during rendering of a frame, etc...)
Each asset, each task instance will of course use memory.
