============================== Scripting ==================================

We use LUA as scripting language but other languages could be interfaced without much pain.

This document is describing HOW Lua is bound to our objects and how to create new objects following
our APIs. This document is NOT describing the LUA APIs that are available in the engine.

LUA is used in different ways :

- LUA Libraries
	What we mean here by library is to provide a list of functions.
	They are not related with task instances.
	They provide APIs for various type of work from opening and reading a file to audio management.	

	# Implementation & extension

	source/LuaLib/ folder contains all the implemented libraries, look at the source as implementation reference.

		ILuaFuncLib.h	: Provides mecanism to register your function into LUA.
		ILuaFuncLib.cpp
		
		CKLBLuaConst.h	: Provides mecanism to register your constants into LUA.
		CKLBLuaConst.cpp
	
	To create a new library, you need to :
	- Implement a class derived from ILuaFuncLib implementing addLibrary() function.
	- Inside your addLibrary function, call addFunction for each function you want to register.
	- Implement each function from your library with the following signature:
	
		int MyLibraryClass::myFunctionForLUA(lua_State * L);
	
		The input parameter is the parameters received from LUA.
		The output int is the number of values returned by the function call.
		
		Wrap the lua_State* with a CLUAState:
		CLuaState lua(L);
		
		Then use lua.*() functions to get the number of arguments, their type and setup the return value(s).
		
	- Create a static instance that passes an optionnal constant array as constructor parameter.
	
	NOTE :
	You may see optionnally code calling a given classID to a CKLBLibRegistrator class.
	In this case, it is related to work done on interfacing with other scripting system and is not related to LUA.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE :
	If your extension source code is not in the project of the executable but is going to be inside
	a C++ library for your compiler then you need to register your LUA library using EngineStdReference.cpp
	It will force to reference the code and linker will include the code, else you may endup with your code not being
	included inside the final exe.

		See EngineLuaFuncReference() implementation.
	
- Task command implementation & extension	
	
	See also Docs/Modules/Tasks.txt for more details about task inheritance.
	
	Inside the tasks system, there is support for implementing commands that can be executed from LUA.
	Commands ARE equivalent to function call from LUA to C++, except that they all use a common pattern.
	
	From LUA language it is always the same function which is called :
	syscommand(taskObject, COMMAND_ID, ...parameters...)
	
	The list of supported commands is registered to the CKLBTaskFactory template with your task class.

	Inside your task implementation MyTaskClass.cpp, you will have something like that :

	// Optionnal constant, just for sake of clean code.
	enum {
		CPP_CONSTANT	= 0,
		...
		...
	};
	
	// Constant table of commands to pass to the factory when registering your task.
	static IFactory::DEFCMD cmd[] = {
		{"COMMAND_CONSTANT",			CPP_CONSTANT		},
		...
		...
		...
		{0, 0}
	};
	// Registration to the factory using template.
	static CKLBTaskFactory<MyTASKClass> factory("ClassNameInLUA", UNIQUE_CLASS_ID, commands);

	... MyTASKClass implementation here ...

	// Implementation of LUA callback to decode argument and execute command.	
	int
	myTaskClass::commandScript(CLuaState& lua)					// In case MyTaskClass is NOT a CKLBUITask subclass. 
	myTaskClass::commandUI(CLuaState& lua, int argc, int cmd)	// In case MyTaskClass IS a CKLBUITask subclass. 
	{
		switch(cmd)
		{
		case CPP_CONSTANT:
			... Implement your command here...
		break;
		...
		...
		}
		
		return luaReturnArgumentCount;
	}
	
	NOTE : it is possible to return MULTIPLE arguments in LUA, as an example a get point coordinate could return X and Y.

	See CLuaState.h for all the get* function to retrieve data from the LUA stack.
	See CLuaState.h for all the ret* function to return data to LUA.
	
	=> See implementation of UI tasks as an example.
	
- Task constructor from LUA

	Implement the virtual function initUI if you are creating a CKLBUITask subclass.
	Implement the virtual function initScript if you are creating a CKLBLuaTask or CKLBLuaPropTask subclass.
	
	bool myTaskClass::initUI(CLuaState& lua) {
		// Read the parameter, create internal objects, return true if successfull.
	}
	
	=> See implementation of UI tasks as an example.

- Task properties implementation & extension

	All classes derived from CKLBLuaPropTask can support having properties accessible for reading and writing
	from LUA.
	
	For historical reason and bad design, the first implementation of CKLBLuaPropTask property mecanism was wasting memory
	and consuming more CPU at initialize. Moreover, it was less compatible with standard getter/setter that could
	be used when mapping another script language.
	
	Because most classes were already written with this scheme in place and we were afraid of having too much regression
	on already working code in production, we choosed to use have a second property accessing scheme in parrallel,
	and the scheme would be selected at runtime and not compile time.
	This way more work was needed, but we could migrate task one by one from the old property scheme to the new one
	without having to worry about impacting already working code.

	The distinction can be done easily :
	inside CKLBLuaPropTask.h there are two structures,
	- PROP		: Struct used by old scheme.
	- PROP_V2	: Struct used by new scheme.

	When a class support the new scheme, IT MUST have the following code inside the C++ constructor:
	
		m_newScriptModel = true;
	
	Then during the init, call to CKLBLuaPropTask::setupPropertyList will use the given parameters differently.
	By doing a "dirty cast", we keep the old API structure as it was, even if internals behave differently.
	
	It is recommended to use the new scheme.
		
	Please take a look at the implementation of various getter/setters for implementation detail.
	
- Garbage collection in LUA.
	
	Each time the script is executed within the script phase, there is also an evaluation of a threshold
	to start a garbage collection within LUA.
	
	See implementation of void CKLBLuaEnv::execScript(int) function.
	
- Callback from C++ to LUA.
	
	In order to be Scripting Language Independant, the Engine does not directly call LUA function.
	Indeed, callbacks signatures are first defined in CKLBScriptEnv.h
	Then, the implementation defiers regarding the Scripting Language used.
	These methods takes the following parameters :
	- the name of the function to call back
	- a pointer to a CKLBObjectScriptable
	- additional parameters to send back to the scripting language
	Both the name or the object pointer can be used to locate the callback to call depending on 
	the scripting language.
	
	For LUA, the function name is used to identify the function to call back.
	The methods implemented redirect the call to a LUA specific method with the following parameters : 
	- the name of the callback function
	- a String corresponding to the callback signature (matching the next arguments)
		The following types are supported and linked with the following letter
		- B : Byte
		- I : Integer
		- N : numeric (double)
		- S : String
		- P : Pointer
		- G : Global 
		For example if a callback must return 2 integers to LUA, the signature will be "II".
	- Additional parameters to send back to LUA
	
	The signature String is then analysed and arguments are pushed on the LUA stack before calling the final 
	LUA function through its name.

- About LUA Script Loading

	Using the "sysLoad" command, it is possible to switch from a LUA file to another LUA file.
	
	Each time we load a new LUA file, our library will try to call the following functions :
	
	setup() function	: When the LUA file loading is complete AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT FRAME after "sysLoad".
	execute() function	: Executed each frame from the NEXT FRAME after "sysLoad"
	leave() function	: Executed directly when "sysLoad" load another file.
	
	Basically, the current LUA file executing "sysLoad" will have its leave() function executed right away.
	Then the file is loaded at the beginning of the NEXT frame, setup() is executed. Then execute() for each frame.
